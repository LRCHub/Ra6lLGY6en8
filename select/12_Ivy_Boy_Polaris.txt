Holy Holly,
She don't approve at all,
She thinks that she's a pony,
Prancing in the front hall,
She sleeps with a saddle on,
Gets up & rides at dawn,
Nobody knows what's wrong,
She can't keep her trousers on.

Humpty the Dumpty,
She's all better now,
She thought that she was somebody
Else for a while.
The house at the North Pole,
She went for her daily stroll,
Wearing a wig & a mink stole,
And she's the daughter of rock & roll.

(Solo)

Ivy Boy,
He couldn't be trusted,
Even his face
Was made of lies,
Tried to be like Monty Hall,
Living like a rubber ball,
Found himself in Montreal,
Ivy can dig it all,
Ivy can dig it all,
Ivy can dig it all,
Ivy can dig it all,
Ivy can dig it all,
Ivy can dig it all,
Ivy can dig it all,
Ivy can dig it all,
Ivy can dig it all,
Ivy can dig it all,
Ivy can dig it all,
Ivy can dig it all,
Ivy can dig it all,
Ivy can dig it all.
