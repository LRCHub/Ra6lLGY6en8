Ivy, you're a girl that I can never taste
I get violent feelings when I see your face
You're so warm and beautiful, and soft and kind
I close my eyes but you are shining in my mind

Oh, Ivy (woo-ooh-ooh)
Ivy (woo-ooh-ooh)

You eat me away, every night and every day
My dreams are nightmares like heads are tails
I can see and hear you
I just can't get near you

Ivy, Ivy
Oh, you destroy me, yes, you do
Ivy, Ivy
Oh, you destroy me, yes, you do

Ivy, you're a thousand girls tormenting me
My minds a hall of mirrors where you're all I see
I get sicker by the second, you're my lifelong curse
My egg shell head is yours to break I feel like dirt

Oh, Ivy (woo-ooh-ooh)
Ivy (woo-ooh-ooh)

You moonlight my stars, you scratch and you scar
I'm a fool for your jewels, it's true
I'm burned out, I'm damged
You're so sweet and savage

Ivy, Ivy
Oh, you destroy me, yes, you do
Ivy, Ivy
Oh, you destroy me, yes, you do

Ivy, Ivy, you destroy me
Ivy, Ivy, you destroy me
Ivy, Ivy, you destroy me
Ivy, Ivy, you destroy me

Ivy, Ivy, you destroy me
Ivy, Ivy, you destroy me
Ivy, Ivy, you destroy me
Ivy, Ivy, you destroy me

You do
Oh, Ivy, you do
Oh, Ivy, you touch me, you chill me
You smile and you kill me
You kiss me, you crown me
You twist me, you drown me, you do
Oh-oh-oh-oh, Ivy
