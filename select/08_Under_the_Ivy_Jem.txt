It wouldn't take me long
To tell you how to find it
To tell you where we'll meet
This little girl inside me
Is retreating to her favourite place
Go into the garden
Go under the ivy
Under the leaves Away from the party
Go right to the rose
Go right to the white rose (For me)
I sit here in the thunder
The green on the grey
I feel it all around me
And it's not easy for me
To give away a secret It's not safe
But go into the garden
Go under the ivy
Under the leaves Away from the party
Go right to the rose
Go right to the white rose (For me)
Go into the garden
Go under the ivy
Go under the leaves with me
Go right to the rose
Go right to the white rose I'll be waiting for you
It wouldn't take me long
To tell you how to find it
